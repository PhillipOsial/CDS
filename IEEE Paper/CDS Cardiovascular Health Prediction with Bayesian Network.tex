\begin{abstract}
In Canadian society, the ubiquity of cardiovascular disease has led to it becoming the second leading cause of death for Canadians. In this paper, we examine the process of creating a clinical decision support system using a Bayesian Network to model and identify the risk factors associated with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. With this research, we hope to increase the preventative techniques available to Canadian citizens and provide a better quality of life for all.

\section{Introduction}
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is part of a category of diseases involving the heart and blood vessels that is now the \textit{second leading} cause of death in Canada \cite{StatsCan}. As a result of its increasing prevalence, large amounts of research is being conducted to try and bring down the instances of death and increase the health of Canadians from coast-to-coast. To accomplish our analysis, we will create a \textit{Bayesian Network} to model our clinical decision making process (CDMS). Afterwards, we evaluate our CDMS using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and determine the area under the curve (AUC).  

\section{Research Motivation}
Nowadays there is a large focus in research in what is called Big Data Analytics (BDA). BDA is the process of analyzing large amounts of data to find hidden patterns and meaning within. Examples of where BDA is making large improvements are the pharmaceutical industry where BDA is allowing researchers to focus on the medications that will be most likely to succeed and in the cases of disease and viral outbreaks where BDA is mapping out the genetic components that are able to stop the diseases from spreading. Our end goal for this research also focuses on the health industry but looks at creating a process for predicting cardiovascular disease in order to hopefully prevent it in the overall Canadian population. An example applicable to our domain follows:
\\
\indent A person goes for a checkup at their family physician. At the checkup they are given a survey to fill out and are run through the usual set of tests. The results from the survey and the tests are then run through the clinical decision making process to determine problem areas of the individual that put them at risk for CVD. Using the results, the individual can take that knowledge and change his lifestyle habits to decrease his likelihood of CVD.
\\
\indent This one example shows a possible usage for the research that will be gained here.

\section{Related Works}
Research in cardiovascular health has steadily increased over the years as it has become more common in the health care fields. Advancements and usage of big data analytics has improved the methods and variety of research that can be conducted on the existing datasets. 
Looking at what was proposed by Sultana et al \cite{7873142}, they analyzed several different heart disease prediction techniques. Through their research they found that Bayes Net and SMO classifiers performed best among their initial five classifiers: Bayes Net, SMO, KStar, MLP and J48. To come up with this conclusion the five classifiers were tested against two sets of data, the UCI standard heart disease dataset as well as collected patient data from Bangladesh. Using the accuracy calculated from the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the AUC from the ROC curve, Bays Net and SMO were found to be the best of the classifiers tested.
   Raihan et al \cite{7860213} proposes a smartphone application heart disease prediction system with data mining techniques. Their proposed system in theory is able to predict Ischemic Heart Disease from a smartphone interface. They suggested that main tools that have a mandatory input of lipid values make them underutilized by the population at large. While such tools are valuable they set out to make a system that is more user friendly to a non medical professional.
   Rosli et al \cite{7808353} proposes another mobile detection system for heart disease but this time looking for early warning signs of fatal heart disease. Their system also uses an Arduino micro-controller to measure the heart rate of the individual. Their system uses photoplethysmography technique and utilizes a GSM shield module to act as an SMS interface. In a survey to test the effectiveness of their system, 100\% of respondents agreed that their system is relevant for the industry.
\section{Data Description}
Our research focused on two datasets. We first examined a dataset as seen in Table \ref{table_statlogheart} and discovered that the data contains multivariate characteristics consisting of both numerical and categorical data types.
This dataset also features no missing values, contains 270 patient instances with 14 attributes, and its primary purpose is to be used for prediction of heart disease by using the first 13 attributes as predictors of the 14\textsuperscript{th} attribute.

\section{Methodology} 
For the first dataset, Table \ref{table_statlogheart}, we simplified our analysis by only using data that was already categorical since categorizing the numerical data could be considered subjective.
The main attributes we considered were sex, thal, hdap, cpt, recg, eia, sop, and fbs.
First, we created an undirected Bayesian Network as seen in Fig. \ref{fig_statloghealth_undirected}. 
We quickly realized that this would of no use to us because we cannot see the direct dependencies between attributes.
This led us to creating a directed Bayesian Network as seen in Fig. \ref{fig_statloghealth}.
The Bayesian Network we created uses the \textit{Hill Climbing} approach to ensure in a completely directed network.
From this directed Bayesian Network, Fig. \ref{fig_statloghealth}, we are able to see how certain attributes depend upon each other.
Since the first dataset, Table \ref{table_statlogheart}, we looked at was too small, we took a look at another repository
